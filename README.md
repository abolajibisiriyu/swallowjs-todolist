## How to serve
1. Install the Firebase CLI (if you have this in your system already you can just skip to the next step)

The Firebase CLI (Command Line Interface) requires Node.js and npm, which can both be installed by following the instructions on https://nodejs.org/. Installing Node.js also installs npm.

2. Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install the Firebase CLI via npm:
    go into the project folder and run
  ```
  firebase serve
  ```
