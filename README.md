A lightweight framework to help kick start your <b>Firebase</b> project to build interactive web interfaces. It's so <strong>Ridiculously Fast & Easy-To-Use</strong> You’ll think it’s magic
- Easy Firebase Integration
- Fast & Easy-To-Use
- Flexible
- Fast without the need for compiling / optimization
- "Logic-less-view" because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead there are only tags.

## How to serve
1. Install the Firebase CLI (if you have this in your system already you can just skip to the next step)

The Firebase CLI (Command Line Interface) requires Node.js and npm, which can both be installed by following the instructions on https://nodejs.org/. Installing Node.js also installs npm.

2. Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install the Firebase CLI via npm:
    go into the project folder and run
  ```
  firebase serve
  ```
