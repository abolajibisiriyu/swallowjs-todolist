## Intro

A lightweight framework to help kick start your Javascript project to build interactive web interfaces. It's so <strong>Ridiculously Fast & Easy-To-Use</strong> You’ll think tt’s magic
- Flexible
- Fast without the need for compiling / optimization
- "logic-less-view" because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead there are only tags.
